        <h3>What is this page?</h3>
        <div>This is a development page for HTML projects hosted on ConnorTheVGFan78.com and it's associated websites. Web pages are developed and tested here publicly before they reach their final homes on the Net.</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
        <h3>Why am I seeing it?</h3>
        <div>It means two things. Firstly, it means that you are snooping around for files or projects you shouldn't have access to (in which case, you should stop <a href="https://youtu.be/c46_iL2QqOE?t=61">before this happens</a>). Secondly, this screen shows up when a project is not in active development on this Dev channel. Think of this page as a placeholder. I could leave it empty and have your web browser return a <i>404: FILE NOT FOUND</i> error, but where's the fun in that?</div>
        <br>

        <h3>Previous Projects that DEV1 has hosted:</h3>
